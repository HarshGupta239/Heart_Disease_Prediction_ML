# Heart_Disease_Prediction_ML
# Introduction
Heart Disease , also known as cardiovascular disease is the primary basis of death worldwide over the span of past few decades. This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But, it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholestrol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors.
So, there should be some method which can predict the heart disease in advance with as much accuracy as possible.
So, with the help of this project, we can predict whether a person has heart disease or not. 
I build a Machine Learning model which will take some input features and will predict the target value based on input features.
I have use the "Logistic Regression" algorithm to train the model because our target variable will give answer in yes or no only.
Types of Attributes:
1. pid: Patient identification number.
2. age: The person's age in years.
3. sex: The person's sex (1=male,0=female)
4. cp: The chest pain experienced (Value
